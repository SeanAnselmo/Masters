    "\n",
    "This is an individual homework assignment. This means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may discuss the problems in this assignment with other students in this course and your instructor/TA, but YOUR WORK MUST BE YOUR OWN.\n",
    "- Do not show other students code or your own work on this assignment.\n",
    "- You may consult external references, but not actively receive help from individuals not involved in this course.\n",
    "- Cite all references outside of the course you used, including conversations with other students which were helpful. (This helps us give credit where it is due!). All references must use a commonly accepted reference format, for example, APA or IEEE (or another citation style of your choice).\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these rules seem ambiguous, please check with with your instructor for help interpreting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest completing this assignment using the provided notebook. Each question should be answered using a SQL query (or combination or SQL queries) unless the text indicates that you may (or should) do something else. You may submit your queries embedded in Python, using SQLAlchemy or the MySQL Connector, or as plain text in Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When you submit your work\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission will be graded manually. To ensure that everything goes smoothly, please follow these instructions to prepare your notebook for submission to the D2L Dropbox for Assignment 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please remove any print statments used to test your work (you can comment them out)\n",
    "- Please provide your solutions where asked; please do not alter any other parts of this notebook.\n",
    "- If you need to add cells to test your code please move them to the end of the notebook before submission- or you may included your commented out answers and tests in the cells provided"

    "First, import the two CSVs into your own database. You may use what is available to you on `datasciencedb`. You may also create indexes and define keys if appropriate for the column(s) of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the section below, you have the option to discuss any data cleaning and wrangling steps performed during this process. This is not a requirement and will not be assessed directly for grading; however, this may help to clarify to your reader exactly what was done, to make your work below more understandable."

If we wanted to utilize the functions of the GeoJSON to work with location more, it would be better stored as a MongoDB.
